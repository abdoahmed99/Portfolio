## Projects
Here I will give a description of each project, describe the technology stack that is used, and lastly the results of the projects.

### Assessing Audience Impact on NBA Player Performance

**R Shiny Web App:** [Link Here](https://abdoahmed.shinyapps.io/shinyapp_v1/)

**Full Project Report:**[`nba_analysis_final_report.pdf`](https://github.com/abdoahmed99/Portfolio/blob/45aaf24e26df128c25a9c6f12fe57cd23edbd1e9/Project%201%20-%20NBA%20Analysis/NBA%20Analysis%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf)


Description: 
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been plenty of uncertainty with restrictions, especially with regards to large events like sports. The NBA was one of the first major sports leagues to shut down in March 2020, and they were one of the first to resume their season in a “bubble” environment with no fans. The bubble took place in Disney World, where all games were played on neutral courts with no fans. The NBA bubble had many crazy moments, with some players having lots of unexpected success. After the bubble season finished, a new NBA season began back in the team’s regular arenas. Depending on the jurisdiction, arena capacity ranged anywhere from 0% to 100%. This trend changed with each wave and development of COVID-19. It is well known throughout sports that fans affect the players in different ways, both positively and negatively. We are curious how the attendance levels at arenas affect player performance. More specifically, we want to quantify the impact the audience has on NBA player performance. This project includes the following steps: Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Analysis, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization 

Skills: Web Scraping, Building a Web Crawler, Statistical Analysis, Data Cleaning, Indexing Data, T-Tests, Proportion Tests, Building a WebApp

Technologies: R, Excel, RVest, Dplyr, GGPlot, Tidyverse, Mosaic, XPath, R Shiny Web Apps, Power Query

Description: I created a Mock Bookstore database system using PostgreSQL as my RDBMS. Additionally, I used Python scripts to connect this database, add tables to the database, and to populate databases. All of these actions will be executed using SQL quesies within the Python script. 

Skills: Connecting to an RDBMS using Python, SQL Querying, Data Visualization

Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, SQL, PosgreSQL, Excel
