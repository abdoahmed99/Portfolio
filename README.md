### Assessing Audience Impact on NBA Player Performance

I highly encourage you to take a look at R Shiny Web App/dashboard for this project [here](https://abdoahmed.shinyapps.io/shinyapp_v1/).

Description: 
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been plenty of uncertainty with restrictions, especially with regards to large events like sports. The NBA was one of the first major sports leagues to shut down in March 2020, and they were one of the first to resume their season in a “bubble” environment with no fans. The bubble took place in Disney World, where all games were played on neutral courts with no fans. The NBA bubble had many crazy moments, with some players having lots of unexpected success. After the bubble season finished, a new NBA season began back in the team’s regular arenas. Depending on the jurisdiction, arena capacity ranged anywhere from 0% to 100%. This trend changed with each wave and development of COVID-19. It is well known throughout sports that fans affect the players in different ways, both positively and negatively. We are curious how the attendance levels at arenas affect player performance. More specifically, we want to quantify the impact the audience has on NBA player performance. This project includes the following steps: Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Analysis, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization
